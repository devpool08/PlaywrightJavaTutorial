# 🎭 Playwright Java Automation Testing Journey

## 📅 Day 1: Introduction & Installation Setup

Welcome to my **Playwright Java** automation testing adventure! 🚀 This is where it all begins - from zero to hero with one of the most powerful browser automation frameworks.

## 🎯 What We Accomplished Today

### 📚 **Introduction to Playwright**
- 🌟 **What is Playwright?** - A Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API
- 🔥 **Built by Microsoft** - Started as a fork of Puppeteer but with superpowers!
- 🌐 **Cross-Browser Testing** - One API to rule them all (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit)
- 💪 **Multiple Language Support** - Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, .NET

### ✨ **Why Playwright is Amazing**

| 🚀 **Cross-Platform** | Works on Windows, Linux, macOS |
| 📱 **Mobile Testing** | Test mobile browsers (Chrome on Android, Safari on iOS) |
| 🎪 **No Flaky Tests** | Built-in auto-wait mechanisms |
| 🔍 **Powerful Debugging** | Playwright Inspector & Trace Viewer |
| 📊 **Multiple Contexts** | Run multiple users/sessions simultaneously |
| 🎨 **Rich Interactions** | Drag & drop, hover, shadow DOM support |

## 🛠️ **Installation Setup Completed**

### 1. ☕ **Java Development Kit (JDK 11)**
```bash
# Verification command
java -version
```
- ✅ Downloaded Oracle JDK 11
- ✅ Set JAVA_HOME environment variable
- ✅ Updated system PATH

### 2. 📦 **Apache Maven 3.9.1**

- ✅ Set MAVEN_HOME environment variable
- ✅ Updated system PATH with /bin folder

### 3. 🌙 **Eclipse IDE**
- ✅ Downloaded Eclipse IDE for Java Developers
- ✅ Extracted and created desktop shortcut
- ✅ Ready for Java development

## 📝 **Environment Variables Setup**

### User Variables:
- `JAVA_HOME` → `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-11`
- `MAVEN_HOME` → `C:\apache-maven-3.9.1`

### System Variables (PATH):
- `%JAVA_HOME%\bin`
- `%MAVEN_HOME%\bin`

## 🎓 **Key Learnings**
